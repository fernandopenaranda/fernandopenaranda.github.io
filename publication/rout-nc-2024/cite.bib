	abstract = {Bilayer graphene encapsulated in tungsten diselenide can host a weak topological phase with 
pairs of helical edge states. The electrical tunability of this phase makes it an ideal platform to investigate 
unique topological effects at zero magnetic field, such as topological superconductivity. Here we couple the 
helical edges of such a heterostructure to a superconductor. The inversion of the bulk gap accompanied by helical 
states near zero displacement field leads to the suppression of the critical current in a Josephson geometry. 
Using superconducting quantum interferometry we observe an even-odd effect in the Fraunhofer interference pattern 
within the inverted gap phase. We show theoretically that this effect is a direct consequence of the emergence of 
helical modes that connect the two edges of the sample. The absence of such an effect at high displacement field, 
as well as in bare bilayer graphene junctions, supports this interpretation and demonstrates the topological 
nature of the inverted gap.},
